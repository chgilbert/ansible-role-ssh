# Host based Authentication --------------------------------------------------

# enable host based authentication
# a good thing to have, but not for beginners, so off by default
sshd_hostbased_auth: 'no'

sshd_ssh_known_hosts: {}

# ignore users known_hosts file
sshd_ignore_user_known_hosts: 'yes'

# ignore users ~/.rhosts and ~/.shosts files
sshd_ignore_rhosts: 'yes'

# HostbasedUsesNameFromPacketOnly
# Specifies whether or not the server will attempt to perform a reverse name
# lookup when matching the name in the ~/.shosts, ~/.rhosts,
# and /etc/hosts.equiv files during HostbasedAuthentication.
# A setting of ''yes'' means that sshd(8) uses the name supplied by the
# client rather than attempting to resolve the name from the TCP
# connection itself. The default is ''no''.
sshd_hostbased_uses_name_from_packet_only: 'no'

# HostKey
# Specifies a file containing a private host key used by SSH.
# The defaults are /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ecdsa_key,
# /etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key and /etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key.
# Note that sshd(8) will refuse to use a file if it is group/world-accessible
# and that the HostKeyAlgorithms option restricts which of the keys are
# actually used by sshd(8).
# It is possible to have multiple host key files. It is also possible to
# specify public host key files instead. In this case operations on the
# private key will be delegated to an ssh-agent(1).
#
# default keys are always generated, but keys not in list, are not used
# if you want to add ecdsa:
# - type: ecdsa
#   path: ssh_host_ecdsa_key
#   size: 521
sshd_host_keys:
  - type: 'rsa'
    path: '/etc/ssh/ssh_host_rsa_key'
    size: 4096
  - type: 'ed25519'
    path: '/etc/ssh/ssh_host_ed25519_key'
    size: 256

# HostKeyAlgorithms and HostKeyAccptedTypes are used from
# ssh_algorithms.keys defined in defaults/main/main.yml
