# Authentication Methods and Settings ----------------------------------------

# authentication methods
# Specifies the authentication methods that must be successfully
# completed for a user is granted	access.
# The available authentication methods are: "gssapi-with-mic",
# "hostbased", "keyboard-interactive", "none" (used for access to
# password-less accounts when PermitEmptyPasswords is enabled),
# "password"	and "publickey".
#
# Example: pubkey and password or pubkey and hostbased required
#
# sshd_authentication_methods: "publickey,password publickey,hostbased"
#
sshd_authentication_methods: "publickey"

# The server disconnects after this time if the user has not successfully
# logged in. If the value is 0, there is no time limit.
# The default is 120 seconds.
sshd_login_grace_time: '60'

# permit root login,
# values are yes, prohibit-password, forced-commands-only, or no
sshd_permit_root_login: 'no'

# maximum number of auth tries
sshd_max_auth_tries: 3

# max sessions per network connection
sshd_max_sessions: 10

# Key baesd Authentication ---------------------------------------------------

# Specifies whether public key authentication is allowed.
# The default is ''yes''.
# Note that this option applies to protocol version 2 only.
sshd_pubkey_auth: 'yes'

# Specifies the file that contains the public keys that can be used for
# user authentication. AuthorizedKeysFile may contain tokens of the form %T
# which are substituted during connection setup. The following tokens are
# defined: %% is replaced by a literal '%', %h is replaced by the home
# directory of the user being authenticated, and %u is replaced by the
# username of that user. After expansion, AuthorizedKeysFile is taken to be
# an absolute path or one relative to the user's home directory.
# The default is ''.ssh/authorized_keys''.

# See https://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.html, Version 5.9 sshd_config

# for versions prior to 5.9 only the first two entries will be used,
# as they only support AuthorizedKeysFile and AuthorizedKeysFile2.
sshd_authorized_keys_files:
  - '.ssh/authorized_keys'

# Password Authentication ----------------------------------------------------

# Specifies whether password authentication is allowed.
# The default is ''yes''.
sshd_password_auth: 'no'

# Specifies whether challenge-response authentication is allowed
# (e.g. via PAM or though authentication styles supported in login.conf(5))
# The default is ''yes''.
sshd_challenge_auth: 'no'

# PAM Authentication ---------------------------------------------------------

# Enables the Pluggable Authentication Module interface. If set to ''yes''
# this will enable PAM authentication using ChallengeResponseAuthentication
# and PasswordAuthentication in addition to PAM account and session module
# processing for all authentication types.
# Because PAM challenge-response authentication usually serves an equivalent
# role to password authentication, you should disable either
# PasswordAuthentication or ChallengeResponseAuthentication.
# If UsePAM is enabled, you will not be able to run sshd(8) as
# a non-root user. The default is ''no''.
# If you just want the PAM account and session checks to run without
# PAM authentication, then enable this but set PasswordAuthentication
# and ChallengeResponseAuthentication to 'no'.
sshd_use_pam: 'yes'

# Misc Settings --------------------------------------------------------------

# Specifies whether sshd(8) should look up the remote host name and check
# that the resolved host name for the remote IP address maps back to the very
# same IP address. The default is ''yes''.
sshd_use_dns: 'yes'
